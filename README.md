# Anti-Procrastination
A C executable file for when I want to look at only one thing at a time.

##Overview
This application aims to use the terminal to minimise distractions around, by providing the tools necessary to focus on the next agenda.
This is run using just C, as this is what I am comfortable using and it ensures that the app is not intensive, aiming to make the app smaller (this helps, but why?).

Future Features to implement include:
- A simple a proper pomodoro timer
- A working todo list
- A simple habit tracker
